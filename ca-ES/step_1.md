## Ada Lovelace Day

This project has been created to celebrate Ada Lovalace Day. If you're a teacher, you can download a School Resource Pack containing which also contains an an assembly plan ([downloads.codeclub.org.uk/ada.zip](http://downloads.codeclub.org.uk/ada.zip)), to introduce children to Ada and her revolutionary ideas.

## Resources

For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

## Learning Objectives

* Variables;
* Lists and random list items;
* Repetition (the `repeat`{:class="blockcontrol"} block).

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges

* "Code Ada to introduce herself" - Changing the text in a `say`{:class="blocklooks"} code block;
* "Personalise your poem" - Using a variable within a `say`{:class="blocklooks"} block;
* "More words" - Adding more verbs, adverbs nouns and adjectives to the lists;
* "More poetry" - Use of different lists to create a different poem.
