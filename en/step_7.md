## Animating the Analytical Engine

Let's animate your computer, so that it looks like it's generating poetry.

--- task ---

Click on your computer sprite, and add this code after the first `say`{:class="block3looks"} block:

You'll find the `repeat`{:class="block3control"} and `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks are in the `Control`{:class="block3control"} section.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
say [Here is your poem...] for (2) seconds
+ repeat (10)
	turn left (5) degrees
	wait (0.1) seconds
	turn right (5) degrees
	wait (0.1) seconds	
end
say (join [I ](item (pick random (1) to (length of [verbs v])) of [verbs v])) for (2) seconds
say (item (pick random (1) to (length of [adverbs v])) of [adverbs v]) for (2) seconds
say (join [by the ](item (pick random (1) to (length of [nouns v])) of [nouns v])) for (2) seconds
say (join [I feel ](item (pick random (1) to (length of [adjectives v])) of [adjectives v])) for (2) seconds
```

Test your project. You should see the computer shake before producing a poem!

Add a `start sound`{:class="block3sound"} block, to play your sound just before your animation starts.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
say [Here is your poem...] for (2) seconds
+ start sound (computer beeps1 v)
repeat (10)
	turn left (5) degrees
	wait (0.1) seconds
	turn right (5) degrees
	wait (0.1) seconds	
end
say (join [I ](item (pick random (1) to (length of [verbs v])) of [verbs v])) for (2) seconds
say (item (pick random (1) to (length of [adverbs v])) of [adverbs v]) for (2) seconds
say (join [by the ](item (pick random (1) to (length of [nouns v])) of [nouns v])) for (2) seconds
say (join [I feel ](item (pick random (1) to (length of [adjectives v])) of [adjectives v])) for (2) seconds
